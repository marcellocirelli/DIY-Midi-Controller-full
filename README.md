# Hammond M3 MIDI Pedals

   Original code by Gustavo Silveira, 2021.
  - This is a custom fork I created to build a MIDI footpedal set similar to the Moog Taurus.
   The pedals, sourced from my chopped 1957 Hammond M3, features: 13 notes, four stompbox style switches
   mapped to various MIDI CC values, an expression pedal, and sustain pedal all housed in a single unit controlled
   by an Arduino Nano, configured for PnP MIDI over USB. The entire pedalboard is 5V USB powered, though can be reconfigured
   to take 5V over MIDI DIN.
